I think CommandValidator will need it's own unit tests,  plus some caching

Issues
------
Remove label code from machine,  this is a feature of the assembler, not the machine
Use C# 7 Pattern matching for some of the nasty switch states

Bigger Bits
-----------
Parser
Memory Visualisation
Front End
Convert commands to opcodes so that can be stored in memory
